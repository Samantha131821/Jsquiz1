# Jsquiz1

The purpose of this assignment was to create a timed multiple choice Javascript quiz.

If the user gets the correct answer, the timer increases by 5 seconds. 

If the user gets the wrong answer, the timer decreases by 5 seconds. 

The score is based on time remaining.

The highscore is stored in local storage and compared to new score.
